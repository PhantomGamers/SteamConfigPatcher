# SteamConfigPatcher

Steam Config Patcher is a utility that allows you to modify settings for your Steam client that are currently unavailable in the native options menu. The current options are:
1. Disable friends categorization by game.
2. Disable event and announcement notifications (e.g payday 2 group notifications)

To use, simply download the repository and extract both SteamConfigPatcher.bat and sfk.exe to the same directory and run SteamConfigPatcher.bat. Depending on the location of your Steam installation folder and the permissions of your account you may have to run the .bat file as administrator, however it should tell you if this is necessary after you run it.
